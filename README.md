# String Inputs in C++

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to handle string inputs in C++.

### Problem

Develop an echo program that takes a line of string from the user and prints the same string to the console.


### Implementation
- Write your code in the main function.
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    /*Your code here*/
    return 0;
}

```
